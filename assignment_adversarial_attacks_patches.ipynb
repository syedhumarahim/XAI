As ImageNet has 1000 classes, simply looking at the accuracy is not sufficient to tell the performance of a model. Imagine a model that always predicts the true label as the second-highest class in its softmax output. Although we would say it recognizes the object in the image, it achieves an accuracy of 0. In ImageNet with 1000 classes, there is not always one clear label we can assign an image to. This is why for image classifications over so many classes, a common alternative metric is \"Top-5 accuracy\", which tells us how many times the true label has been within the 5 most-likely predictions of the model. As models usually perform quite well on those, we report the error (1 - accuracy) instead of the accuracy:"

        "\n",
        "Instead of changing every pixel by a little bit, we can also try to change a small part of the image into whatever values we would like. In other words, we will create a small image patch that covers a minor part of the original image but causes the model to confidentially predict a specific class we choose. This form of attack is an even bigger threat in real-world applications than FSGM. Imagine a network in an autonomous car that receives a live image from a camera. Another driver could print out a specific pattern and put it on the back of his/her vehicle to make the autonomous car believe that the car is actually a pedestrian. Meanwhile, humans would not notice it. [Tom Brown et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf) proposed a way of learning such adversarial image patches robustly in 2017 and provided a short demonstration on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/i1sp4X57TL4). Interestingly, if you add a small picture of the target class (here *toaster*) to the original image, the model does not pick it up at all. A specifically designed patch, however, which only roughly looks like a toaster, can change the network's prediction instantaneously.\n",

        "\n",
        "Let's take a closer look at how we can actually train such patches. We calculate gradients for the input, and update our adversarial input correspondingly. We do not calculate a gradient for every pixel. Instead, we replace parts of the input image with our patch and then calculate the gradients just for our patch. Secondly, we don't just do it for one image, but we want the patch to work with any possible image. Hence, we have a whole training loop where we train the patch using SGD. Lastly, image patches are usually designed to make the model predict a specific class, not just any other arbitrary class except the true label. For instance, we can try to create a patch for the class \"toaster\" and train the patch so that our pretrained model predicts the class \"toaster\" for any image with the patch in it.\n",

Given a model to fool, a target class to design the patch for, and a size $k$ of the patch in the number of pixels, we first start by creating a parameter of size $3\\times k\\times k$. These are the only parameters we will train, and the network itself remains untouched. We use a simple SGD optimizer with momentum to minimize the classification loss of the model given the patch in the image. While we first start with a very high loss due to the good initial performance of the network, the loss quickly decreases once we start changing the patch. In the end, the patch will represent patterns that are characteristic of the class. For instance, if we would want the model to predict a \"goldfish\" in every image, we would expect the pattern to look somewhat like a goldfish. Over the iterations, the model finetunes the pattern and, hopefully, achieves a high fooling accuracy."
